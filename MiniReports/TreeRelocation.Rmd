# Tree relocation

Our protocol for plot locations includes collection of survey-grade GNSS data for at least 15 minutes over a reference point for 
each plot. These data were differentially corrected using post-processing and a nearby CORS base station. From previous work, we
know that position accuracy is in the range of 1-2m under dense canopy with some locations with errors of up to ~5m. Unfortunately,
there are no indicators to tell us when a large error occurs. This all has to do with the geometry of the large trees in the area,
atmospheric conditions, and satellite geometry when data are collected. We use the plot location as a starting point to develop stem
maps for each plot using the azimuth and distance the center of each tree. Using FUSION, we can display individual tree models in the
point cloud and compare our tree locations with the point data that presumably represents the same trees. Overall our locations are good.
However, when we are working with high density airborne lidar data with accuracy in the 10-20cm range, even slight errors can result in 
errors when matching trees detected using the point cloud or derived products to our field trees.

For this project, we manually adjusted tree locations and tree lean to ensure that field trees were correctly matched to lidar-derived trees.
The manual adjustment process was facilitated by modifications to FUSION and the LDV data viewer. These modifications allow you to adjust
all trees on a plot to correct GNSS errors as well as individual tree base and top locations to correct azimuth or distance errors and 
errors in the top location due to tree lean. Adjustments were done independently by two people giving us an idea of the consistency and
repeatability of the adjustment process.

The adjustment process is described in a separate document (MS word document). Basically, the process involves displaying tree models in the point
cloud and providing the ability to adjust the location of all trees on a plot and individual trees. With the high-density UAS lidar data (~1000 pulse/m^2^),
we often have enough hits on stems to allow us to align the tree models with stem hits. For overall plot adjustments, having stem hits for a few 
trees on the plot is enough to shift all of the trees to approximate locations. Once the overall adjustment is completed, individual tree adjustments
can be done. For individual trees, we tended to start with the tallest trees on the plot. We moved the base fo the tree to align with stem hits when possible.
In the absence of stem hits, we relied on the upper canopy points to position trees and then adjusted the base location to align with the crown center.
In many case, we found that stem hits in the upper drown were evident once the initial adjustments were made. Once we were satisifed with the base location,
we adjusted the location of the tree top to align with the bulk of the crown returns. In some cases, we could use the highest point in the crown to 
position the top but often the highest point was not centered on the crown. For such cases, we snapped the tree top to the highest point in the crown
but then adjusted the horizontal location so the geometric primitive representing the tree crown better encompassed the crown.

The data for the adjusted locations is in [AdjustedTrees_AllPlots.csv](../extras/AdjustedTrees_AllPlots.csv).

```{r}
originalPlotTrees <- read.csv(file = "../extras/AdjustedTrees_AllPlots.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

There are `r nrow(originalPlotTrees)` trees that were adjusted.

## Comparing adjustments

As mentioned above, two people independently adjusted the trees allowing us to compare the results of the adjustment process. The following boxplots 
show the differences between the base and top locations for the two people for each plot. Overall, the locations agree well. Differences for he tree 
bases are a little larger, probably because it is harder to find points on the stems compared to the tree tops.

```{r}
{
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(diff ~ PlotID, data = originalPlotTrees
        , main = "Tree base location differences\nBob & Ally"
        , xlab = "Plot number"
        , ylab = "Horizontal difference (m)")
boxplot(diffTop ~ PlotID, data = originalPlotTrees
        , main = "Tree top location differences\nBob & Ally"
        , xlab = "Plot number"
        , ylab = "Horizontal difference (m)")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
}
```

These histograms provide the distribution of the differences.

```{r}
{
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(originalPlotTrees$diff, main = "Tree base location difference (m)")
hist(originalPlotTrees$diffTop, main = "Tree top location difference (m)")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
}
```

These boxplots show the difference from the original tree locations (base and top) and the new locations for each person. These
plots highlight the apparent errors in the original plot location for plots 9 and 13. These are the boxes that stand above all the
others.

```{r}
{
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(origdiff.Ally ~ PlotID, data = originalPlotTrees
        , main = "Tree base location differences\nAlly & Field"
        , ylim = c(0, 8)
        , xlab = "Plot number"
        , ylab = "Horizontal difference (m)")
boxplot(origdiff.Bob ~ PlotID, data = originalPlotTrees
        , main = "Tree base location differences\nBob & Field"
        , ylim = c(0, 8)
        , xlab = "Plot number"
        , ylab = "Horizontal difference (m)")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
}
```

Finally, this plot shows the difference in tree height for the two people.

```{r}
boxplot(heightdiff ~ PlotID, data = originalPlotTrees
        , main = "Tree height difference\nBob & Ally"
        , ylim = c(0, 8)
        , xlab = "Plot number"
        , ylab = "Vertical difference (m)")
```

To help eliminate any mismatched trees, I assumed that trees with position differences greater than 1m or height differences
greater than 1m were likely due to matching different field trees to trees evident in the lidar point cloud. I first removed
any trees with a location difference greater than 1m. This plot shows the height differences for the remaining trees.

```{r}
# drop any trees where the base locations differ by more than 1m
distThreshold <- 1
trainingTrees <- originalPlotTrees[originalPlotTrees$diff <= distThreshold, ]

#580 trees after filtering to remove trees with horizontal position differences > 1m

# height differences between Ally & Bob for trees within 1m
boxplot(heightdiff ~ PlotID, data = trainingTrees
        , main = "Tree height difference\nBob & Ally"
        , ylim = c(0, 8)
        , xlab = "Plot number"
        , ylab = "Vertical difference (m)")
```

While it certainly possible that the two people selected different high points for some trees, I assumed that trees with more than
1m of difference in the heights were different trees so I dropped them from the set of trees used for training our classification model.
The plot shows the height difference for the final set of trees.

```{r}
heightThreshold <- 1
trainingTrees <- trainingTrees[trainingTrees$heightdiff <= heightThreshold, ]

# 575 trees after filtering based on location and height difference thresholds

# height difference between Bob & Ally for final trees
boxplot(heightdiff ~ PlotID, data = trainingTrees
        , main = "Tree height difference (Bob - Ally)"
        , ylim = c(0, 1.1)
        , xlab = "Plot number"
        , ylab = "Vertical difference (m)")
```

Given that we are using the upper crown morphology to distinguish Douglas-fir from western hemlock, I thought there might be some
relationship between species and the height error. The following plots show the errors by species. It doesn't look like there is any
relationship between the height differences and species.

```{r}
{
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(heightdiff ~ PlotID, data = trainingTrees[trainingTrees$Species == "PSME",]
        , main = "PSME\nTree height difference (Bob - Ally)"
        , ylim = c(0, 1.1)
        , xlab = "Plot number"
        , ylab = "Vertical difference (m)")
boxplot(heightdiff ~ PlotID, data = trainingTrees[trainingTrees$Species == "TSHE",]
        , main = "TSHE\nTree height difference (Bob - Ally)"
        , ylim = c(0, 1.1)
        , xlab = "Plot number"
        , ylab = "Vertical difference (m)")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
}
```
